RECOMMENDED_SELLERS = """
    The seller recommendation system works by evaluating different metrics related
    to the seller's performance over the last 30 days. Here's how it works:

    1.  Total Sales: It looks at how much the seller has sold in the last 30 days, focusing only on orders that were delivered.

    2.  Total Shop Value: It adds up the prices of all the seller's active products that are currently for sale.

    3.  Product Views: It counts how many times the sellerâ€™s products were viewed by customers in the last 30 days.

    4.  Active Listings: It counts how many products the seller currently has available for sale.

    5.  Seller Score: It combines all these metrics (sales, shop value, and views) into one score. 
        The total sales are given the most weight (50%), the shop value is given a smaller weight (30%),
        and product views are given the least weight (20%).
"""

OFFER_OVERVIEW = """
    This class encapsulates the business logic related to 
    offers and ensures consistency in actions such as accepting, rejecting, and countering offers.

    Functionality Overview:
    -----------------------
    - **Accept Offer**: Handles the logic for accepting an offer made by a buyer. This changes 
      the status of the offer to "ACCEPTED", sets an expiry time, and notifies the relevant 
      parties of the acceptance.

    - **Reject Offer**: Allows either the buyer or seller to reject an offer, changing the 
      status to "REJECTED", and notifying the opposite party about the rejection.

    - **Counter Offer**: Enables both buyers and sellers to counter an existing offer. The 
      counter action cancels the current offer and creates a new child offer linked to the 
      original (root) offer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation process.

    - **Offer History Management**: When an offer is accepted, rejected, or countered, the 
      entire chain of offers (parent and children) related to the original offer is retrieved 
      and included in the response to provide a full context of the negotiation.

    - **Notification System**: Automatically triggers notifications to the relevant users 
      (seller or buyer) when an offer is accepted, rejected, or countered, ensuring that 
      both parties stay informed about the status of their offers.

    Key Rules:
    -------------------
    - An offer is created by the buyer with a status of "PENDING".
    - The seller can then accept, reject, or counter the offer.
    - If countered, the current offer is cancelled, and a new offer is created as a child of 
      the original offer, forming a hierarchical negotiation structure.
    - Both buyer and seller can continue to counter offers until either party accepts or rejects.
    - No modifications can be made to an offer with a "CANCELLED" status.
    - The entire chain of offers (root and children) is retrieved to maintain a record of 
      the negotiation process.
